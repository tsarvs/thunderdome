/**
 * A hand-declared local copy of the parts of `@thunderdome/research-core`'s schema
 * (packages/research/core/src/**) this bot actually reads — not imported, for the same reason
 * `../marketTypes.ts` doesn't import `@thunderdome/game-stock-market-4`: `bots/**` isn't a Yarn
 * workspace member. This is also the architectural boundary the task requires: the GAME
 * (`stock-market-4`) never knows this shape exists — `observation.research` is `unknown` to it —
 * but a bot is explicitly allowed to know and interpret the research schema. A real match's
 * `config.researchTimeline[].payload` is produced by calling research-core's own
 * `createResearchSnapshot(dataset, timestamp)` outside the game entirely; what lands in
 * `observation.research` is exactly that function's return value, field-for-field as declared
 * in packages/research/core/src/snapshot/snapshot.ts and state/state.ts.
