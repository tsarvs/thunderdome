 * diversification. For each ticker, computes its average correlation against every OTHER ticker's
 * own real trailing returns, then maps that to a size-scaling factor: uncorrelated (avg 0) or
 * NEGATIVELY correlated (avg < 0) keeps the full target — an anti-correlated pair is a real hedge,
 * a diversification BENEFIT, not a concentration risk, so it is deliberately never penalized here
 * (only positive correlation is averaged in; a negative correlation contributes 0, not a negative
 * number that would otherwise cancel out a genuinely concentrated OTHER pairing). Only positive
 * average correlation (toward 1) scales down toward `minScaleFactor`, at a rate set by
 * `concentrationPenalty`. Only ever scales DOWN, never up — being uncorrelated or hedged isn't a
 * reason to size UP a position, only being redundant with the rest of the book is a reason to
 * size DOWN.
