 * trend/stop-loss scaling — stays exactly as-is, per-security) and, ONLY where two or more
 * securities share enough research exposure to represent one underlying bet, scales the WHOLE
 * group down proportionally so their combined exposure respects `policy.maxGroupWeight`. A
 * security's own action can therefore differ from what its raw signal alone would produce (spec
 * §25) — explicitly captured in `adjustments`, not silently absorbed into the final number.
 *
 * Never scales a group UP, and never touches a group whose combined weight is already within the
 * cap — this only ever reduces concentration, it does not redistribute freed-up weight to anything
 * else (that would be reintroducing exactly the kind of allocator spec §27's predecessor bots
 * deliberately avoided; this optimizer's own job is strictly "don't double-count one bet," nothing
 * more).
