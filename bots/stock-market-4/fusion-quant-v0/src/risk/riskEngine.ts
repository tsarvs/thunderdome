 * The independent RISK stage (plan Phase 1, item 6 — the critique's key distinction): takes
 * portfolio construction's desired weights and ONLY EVER SHRINKS them toward zero, in three
 * sequential passes (single-position cap, liquidity/ADV-proxy cap, thesis-group cap — reusing
 * `fusion-fundamental-v7`'s own `applyThesisGroupCaps`, unchanged, for the last one). Every
 * shrink is reported in `adjustments` with WHY, never silently applied — this stage never
 * overrides or replaces the alpha/portfolio-construction opinion, only reports what it wouldn't
 * let through at full size. When nothing needs shrinking, `weightByTicker` is byte-identical to
 * `desiredWeightByTicker` and `adjustments` is empty — see `test/risk/riskEngine.test.ts` for the
 * pass-through contract this is meant to guarantee.
