/**
 * The classic "model fair value vs. market price" alpha, reusing `fusion-fundamental-v7`'s
 * `computeCompanyValuation`/`computeFusionValue` output (unchanged in this bot — see
 * `../decision.ts`, which computes `fairValuePerShare` the same way that bot's `decision.ts` did)
 * rather than re-deriving fair value here. `confidence` is a fixed, deliberately moderate constant
 * — NOT derived from the gap's own size (a huge, unqualified gap isn't more trustworthy just for
 * being huge) — since this alpha's real uncertainty is already reflected in whatever weight `ic.ts`
 * ends up measuring for it historically, not in a per-round confidence guess.
