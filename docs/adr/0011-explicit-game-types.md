# ADR-0011: Explicit Game Types for Stock Market 4

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Stock Market 4 roadmap treats `HISTORICAL`, `SYNTHETIC`, and `FORWARD_SHADOW` as three modes
of ONE game — sharing trading, execution, portfolio, and scoring logic — differing only in how a
match obtains/exposes information and how its lifecycle operates. Today, `games/stock-market-4`
has no field expressing which of these a given match is. The nearest-looking existing field,
`config.marketDataMode` (`'historical' | 'synthetic'`, `types.ts`), is a **data-provenance label**
only — is the price series real or fabricated? — with zero effect on match behavior. Once
`FORWARD_SHADOW` exists as a real concept, reusing or overloading that field's vocabulary for
match-lifecycle semantics would produce a confusing config surface: a `FORWARD_SHADOW` match
replaying genuinely real prices is still, correctly, `marketDataMode: 'historical'`.

A later, separate roadmap phase (deliberately out of scope here) makes `FORWARD_SHADOW` matches
persistent and resumable across process restarts, advancing one real trading day at a time, with
crash/restart equivalence as a first-class correctness requirement. Nothing in
`@thunderdome/engine`'s `GameDefinition` contract offers any pause/resume/persist-across-processes
mechanism today — `runMatch` runs a match to completion in one process, synchronously. This ADR
does not attempt to solve that; it only establishes the type discriminator and gives it one honest,
bounded, single-process lifecycle effect, so the later persistence work has a real distinction to
build on top of rather than inventing one from scratch under time pressure.

## Decision

**Add `config.gameType`**: `'HISTORICAL' | 'SYNTHETIC' | 'FORWARD_SHADOW'`, default `'HISTORICAL'`
— additive and fully backward compatible; every match config predating this field behaves
identically to before. `'HISTORICAL'`/`'SYNTHETIC'` behave IDENTICALLY to each other and to prior
behavior: the full nominal `[startDate, endDate]` trading calendar always plays out, regardless of
how sparse a `config.marketDataset` actually is.

**`'FORWARD_SHADOW'` requires `config.marketDataset`** — inline `historicalPrices`/
`corporateActions` is a fixed blob fully authored before the match starts, which cannot represent
data that isn't all known yet. Enforced in `StockMarket4ConfigSchema`'s `superRefine`, checked
before the pre-existing marketDataset/inline mutual-exclusivity check so this case gets its own
clear message.

**The one lifecycle effect Phase 2 adds**: for `FORWARD_SHADOW` only, the effective trading
calendar (`game.ts`'s `effectiveTradingCalendar`) is trimmed to `state.forwardShadowCutoffDate` —
the **`MIN`** of `MarketDataProvider.latestKnownDate(ticker)` (a new, additive provider method)
across every ticker in `config.marketDataUniverse`. This is the ONLY place `gameType` affects
anything: no other function (`resolve`, execution, portfolio accounting, scoring) branches on it —
concrete evidence the roadmap's "no duplicated trading logic" requirement holds.

**Why `MIN`, never `MAX`.** A real ingestion pipeline can easily have one ticker's data land before
another's on any given day. Using `MAX` across the universe would advance the calendar past a date
where some *traded* ticker has no data yet, corrupting this game's existing "a missing bar is a
genuine data gap" contract (`bar: null`) into "the match ran out of data," systematically, every
day, for whichever ticker happens to lag. `MIN` gives the honest reading: "every ticker this match
can trade is known through at least this date." `config.benchmarkTicker` is deliberately excluded
from this computation — a benchmark is a comparison yardstick, not necessarily even tradeable (see
its own doc comment in `types.ts`), and must never gate how long a match can run.
`games/stock-market-4/test/gameType.test.ts` has a dedicated regression test (two tickers at
different freshness) protecting this — do not "simplify" the cutoff back to a single dataset-wide
query without re-reading that test first.

**Cached once, in `initialize()`.** `forwardShadowCutoffDate` is resolved once (querying the
provider per traded ticker) and stored as a scalar on `StockMarket4State`, never recomputed inside
`tradingCalendarFor`/`effectiveTradingCalendar` — those remain the cheap, pure, in-memory functions
called every round from `getObservation`/`resolve`/`isTerminal`/`getResult` that they already were.
The trimmed calendar array itself is NOT cached — only the cutoff date — for the same
"duplicated, driftable data" reason this file already avoids caching the calendar itself.

**Zero playable rounds is a hard `initialize()` throw**, not a silently-empty match: if the
cutoff falls before `config.startDate`, `initialize()` throws with a clear message. This matches
`buildMarketDataProvider`'s existing convention for setup-time-fatal problems — `initialize()`
returns `TState` directly (not a `Result`), so throwing is the only mechanism available.

**`totalRounds` reflecting the trimmed count is not an information leak.** It's derived entirely
from what the dataset already publicly declares at match start (which dates it has data through) —
the same category of already-public fact as `config.endDate` itself.

## Consequences

- Fully additive: all 206 pre-existing `stock-market-4` tests and all 27 pre-existing
  `market-data` tests pass unchanged, except one intentional one-line update — the single
  full-literal `getResult()` assertion in `game.test.ts` needed `gameType: 'HISTORICAL'` added
  (the same kind of update `marketDataMode` itself required when it was added).
- `MarketDataProvider` gains `latestKnownDate(ticker): CalendarDate | null` — an additive,
  narrowly-scoped primitive (an index-only `MAX(date)` lookup); the `MIN`-across-a-universe policy
  is deliberately NOT baked into the provider itself, and lives in `game.ts` instead, so a future
  consumer with a different policy (e.g. a different game, or a different aggregation rule) isn't
  stuck with this one.
- **This does NOT add persistence, cross-process resume, or crash/restart guarantees.** Running a
  `FORWARD_SHADOW` match today plays exactly what's currently published, once, in one process, then
  exits — a later invocation against a grown dataset starts a brand-new match from round 0. Making
  this resumable is separate, later roadmap work. This ADR doesn't foreclose it:
  `buildMarketDataProvider(config)` staying a pure function of `config` (true since Phase 1, ADR-
  0010) means a future resume mechanism can plausibly just re-run it from persisted config, never
  needing to serialize the live SQLite handle itself.
- Does not add any CLI stepping/pause mode, baseline bots (`Cash`/`BuyAndHold`/`EqualWeight`), or
  single-vs-multi-bot handling changes — all separate, later phases; nothing here blocks them.
- Does not add an explicit close/dispose call for the `MarketDataProvider`'s SQLite handle — still
  out of scope per ADR-0010's own consequences section; `FORWARD_SHADOW` existing doesn't change
  that calculus (still one match, one process, one handle, process-exit-cleaned-up).
