// The registry-driven CLI (@thunderdome/registry + apps/cli) resolves a game manifest's
// `entryPackage` and dynamically imports it — it can't statically know each game's own export
// name (`stockMarket4` here), so every game's entrypoint must also export its GameDefinition under
// this fixed name (games/rock-paper-scissors/src/index.ts established the convention).
