/**
 * Same shape as `@thunderdome/engine`'s own `Result<T>` — reimplemented rather than imported,
 * since this package has no dependency on the engine (it's a generic data layer, usable by any
 * game or none at all). Every fallible operation here (opening a store, resolving a dataset
 * version) returns this instead of throwing, matching `@thunderdome/tournament-store`'s own
 * "never throw on a missing/corrupt record" convention.
