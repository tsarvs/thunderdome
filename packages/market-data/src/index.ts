/**
 * @thunderdome/market-data — a SQLite-backed, versioned market-data store, sitting behind a
 * generic `MarketDataProvider` abstraction. See README.md and
 * `docs/adr/0010-sqlite-market-data-store.md` for why this package exists and how it fits the
 * repo's otherwise-standing "no database" constraint.
 *
 * Populated incrementally; this barrel is the only import surface consumers should use.
