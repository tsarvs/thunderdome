// file named "sqlite" — see this package's README for the full explanation. `createRequire` is a
// plain runtime `require()` call, invisible to Vite's static import analysis, and works
// identically under `tsc`'s compiled ESM output at real runtime (Node's own `createRequire` is
// unaffected by any of this — it's purely a build/test-tooling workaround).

 * outside this package's own `store/`/`provider/` modules should touch the raw handle, so a
 * consumer (a game) only ever sees the higher-level `MarketDataProvider` in `provider/provider.ts`.
 *
 * `node:sqlite`'s `DatabaseSync` is fully synchronous, matching every `GameDefinition` method
 * (`initialize`/`resolve`/`getObservation`/...) already being synchronous — no async wrapper layer
 * needed anywhere this store is used. Chosen over `better-sqlite3` specifically to avoid adding
 * this repo's first native/compiled dependency; see ADR-0010 for the full reasoning.
