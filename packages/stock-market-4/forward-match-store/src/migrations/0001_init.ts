/**
 * One row per match, keyed by `match_id` — replaces the original one-JSON-file-per-match design
 * (see `docs/adr/0013-forward-match-persistence.md` and
 * `docs/adr/0014-sqlite-standard-and-migrations.md`). `config`/`snapshot` stay opaque JSON-text
 * blob columns: this package still never depends on `@thunderdome/engine` or any game (ADR-0013's
 * boundary is unchanged — only the storage medium is). `participant_ids`/
 * `forfeited_participant_ids` are small JSON-encoded string arrays, not normalized into a child
 * table — not worth it at this size, matching this repo's general restraint on over-normalizing.
 *
 * Unlike research/market-data content, forward-match ROWS are never git-tracked migrations —
 * this table's SCHEMA comes from a migration, but a match's own rows are ordinary runtime writes
 * (a match's portfolio state changes every round it plays; that's not reviewable curated content).
