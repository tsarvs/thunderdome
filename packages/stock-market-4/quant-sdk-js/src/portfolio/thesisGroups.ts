/**
 * Groups tickers that share enough of their research EXPOSURE FOOTPRINT (see
 * `../research/exposure.ts`'s `exposureFootprint`) to represent the same underlying
 * commercialization bet, not genuinely independent positions (spec §20/§42 — "FREEM + GFUZ may
 * appear to be two securities but could contain substantial common exposure to the same
 * commercialization pathway"). Plain union-find over pairwise footprint overlap — no assumed/
 * hardcoded pairing, no ticker ever hardcoded as "these two are correlated"; the graph itself
 * decides, from whatever `@thunderdome/research-fusion` currently records. A ticker with no
 * meaningful overlap with anything ends up in its own singleton group, which is a legitimate,
 * expected outcome (most of the book, most of the time), not a bug.
