/**
 * One-off migration: reads the CURRENT `data/dataset.json` (the last artifact of the old
 * JSON-file-based research pipeline) and writes it out as `@thunderdome/research-store`'s seed
 * migration — the first migration-file-based research content this repo ships (see
 * `docs/adr/0014-sqlite-standard-and-migrations.md`). Zero judgment: a mechanical export of what's
 * already there, exactly like `migrateFixtureToJson.ts` was for the JSON-file move before it.
 * Kept in the repo afterward as documentation of how the seed migration was produced, not deleted
 * once run — re-running it would just regenerate an identical file, since `data/dataset.json` is
 * deleted once this migration lands (see `scripts/applyResearchUpdate.ts`, which replaces
 * `data/dataset.json` edits with new migration files from here on).
 *
 * Usage: yarn workspace @thunderdome/research-fusion run generate:fusion-seed-migration
